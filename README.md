# Sneakerpoint
Sneaker marketplace for new and used sneakers.

Please visit the website [here](https://sneakerpoint.herokuapp.com/).

## Introduction and purpose

The Sneakerpoint e-commerce website has been developed as part of the Milestone project 5 for Code Institute Diploma in Software Development with eCommerce. The Sneakerpoint is an e-commerce applicationbuilt in Django, incorporating Python, CSS and HTML.

The application provides a fully functional solution for a e-commerce business selling new and used sneakers. Business owner and the admin of the application is able to manage products available throughout the website as well as users (Sneakpoint customers), orders and queries from customers.
The target audience of the site are users who look to purchase either new or used sneakers. Customers of Sneakerpoint are allowed to register and manage their user profiles as well as complete orders, including payment for the order.

## Design 

The below section of the document outlines development journey of the application starting from the concept to ultimate solution used to develop the site.

### 1 Concept

The concept of the project was to develop a fully functional e-commerce application, which would allow the business owner to run a business.
The business owner/site administrator is able to manage many of the functions via Django's admin portal however a functionality has been developed to allow site administrator to manage upload, edit and deletion of products via user interface. 
As for the target audience and ultimate users of the applications, are the customers interested in purchasing sneakers. In order to faciliate the process a customer profile can be created in order to retain key customer information such as address and contact details.

From a business point of view the desire was to develop an application, which would be user friendly, simple to use and browse the products as well as complete the purchase, using credit or debit cards.

### 2 Functional scope 

In terms of overall functional scope of the application the following key areas were needed to be developed in order for the site to operate as required:

**Site admin** - the primary means of managing the site from admin point of view is through a default admin portal supplied by Django's framework. With that said, the site admin is also allowed to manage products via user interface (Sneakerpoint site), whereby a product can be added, edited and deleted if necessary.

**Registration and Login**- site visitors and potential customers are invited to register via an option available in the navbar menu Customer Centre. The registration and login process is supported by Django's allauth solution. The registration process has been enhanced through email notifications, which users receive at the time of registration on the site.

**User Profile** - once registered customers can maintain and update their customer details, including address information. The profile also allows the users to view orders, which have been placed previously.

**Contact Us**- this functionality allows registered and unregistered site users to send queries to Sneakerpoint. The Contact Us is available through Customer Centre in the navbar and allows the users to submit query or a question they may have. Submissions are handled through a form available to users, and which requires user to provide their email address, subject and the actual message. Once the request is submitted users will receive confirmation that the query has been received. The actual queries are recorded in the database for site admin or the business owner to review and respond to client. The responses will need to be managed through an external email for now.

**Customer Reviews**- THIS SECTION IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT

**Wishlist**- THIS SECTION IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT

**Bag** - this functionality allows customers to add products to a bag, should they decide to proceed and complete the purchase. Each addition of a product will update the bag and also provide user with a notificaiton message. Within the bag the user may take actions to update the quantity of product or remove them from the bag. The bag also allows the users to proceed to checkout section, where the purchase can be completed.

**Checkout**- this part of functionality allows the users to complete the purchase of product/s they have selected. As part of the checkout process, the user will be required to provide their details such as name, email address and a shipping address. Users will also need to provide credit card details in order to complete the purchase.

**Card payments**- the application incorporates credit card payment solution provided by Stripe in order to complete payments. The solution allows to provide real time feedback to customers in event if the credit card payment is rejected or the card number is incorrect. There are mutliple events, which Stripe will provide detailed feedback on to a user if required.


### 3 Solution 

In order to develop the application, and given the functional needs the following solutions were used:

**Languages**

Given the fact that the nature of the application allows for a frequent content manipulation, a standard HTML solution would not work.
The solution needed to incorporate Python in order to make the solution more agile, in terms of development of relevant functions and in order for the user actions to be able to interact with the database in place. 
As part of the development the following languages were used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Python
-Javascript

**Database**

The application required a database structure, which would support managing various aspects of running the e-commerce business.
The key needs from databasr perspective were related to managing products, profiles/accounts, orders, customer queries, customer reviews and wishlist.
For the purpose of managing database related needs, Postgresql was selected as a solution for this project.

The below reflects database schema developed in order to support the needs of this project.
